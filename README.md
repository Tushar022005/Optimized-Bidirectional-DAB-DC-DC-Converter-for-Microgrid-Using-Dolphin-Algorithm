🎯 Project Objective

Develop a state-space mathematical model of a bidirectional DAB converter suitable for microgrid energy storage interfaces.

Implement Phase-Shift Modulation (PSM) based current control.

Optimize PI controller gains (Kp, Ki) using DEA to minimize the Integral Absolute Error (IAE).

Validate controller performance using MATLAB Simulink simulations for voltage regulation, power flow, and transient response.

⚙️ System Overview
Converter

Topology: Dual Active Bridge (DAB) bidirectional isolated DC-DC converter

Ports:

High-Voltage side: 1000 V DC link (PV / grid interface)

Low-Voltage side: 500 V storage bus (battery or ultracapacitor)

Transformer turns ratio: 1:2

Soft-switching (ZVS) operation achieved via Phase-Shift Modulation

Power Control

Buck mode: HV → LV energy flow

Boost mode: LV → HV energy flow

Power is regulated using phase shift between primary and secondary bridge voltages.

🧠 Control Strategy

Inner current control loop

PI compensator generates phase shift command

Feed-forward compensation for port voltage variations

Phase shift ensures zero steady-state error and fast dynamic tracking.

🐬 Dolphin Echolocation Algorithm (DEA)

The script dolphin2.m implements DEA for controller tuning:

DEA Parameters

Population size = 10

Maximum iterations = 20

Search ranges:

Kp ∈ [0, 10]

Ki ∈ [0, 5]

Fitness function = Integral of Absolute Error (IAE)

Each dolphin represents a candidate PI gain pair. Simulations run inside the optimization loop and the best candidate is selected based on lowest IAE.

✅ Optimized Controller Gains

After 20 DEA iterations, the optimal gains obtained were:

Kp = 5.3558
Ki = 2.8991


These gains achieved:

✅ 56.5% faster settling time

✅ 98% overshoot reduction

✅ 45.8% lower IAE

✅ 50% lower ISE

✅ Significantly better voltage tracking vs manual tuning

🚀 How to Run the Project
Step-1: Requirements

MATLAB R2021a (or newer)

Simulink

Simscape Electrical / SimPowerSystems Toolbox

Step-2: Run Optimization

Open MATLAB.

Navigate to this repository folder.

Open Simulink model:

open_system('dab.slx')


Run DEA optimization:

run dolphin2.m

Step-3: What Happens

DEA injects (Kp, Ki) candidates into the workspace as Kp_var and Ki_var.

dab.slx runs simulations using these gains.

Error signal is exported via a To Workspace block as error_signal.

IAE is calculated and fed back into DEA.

DEA converges to optimal PI gains and prints:

Optimal Kp = 5.3558
Optimal Ki = 2.8991


Final waveforms and responses appear directly in Simulink scopes.
